Hey! I'm a CompSci major currently working at a FinTech company in the US. The primary purpose of this page is *not* the markets, though. I'm a huge fan of NBA basketball and music, so this blog will primarily be focused on analytics and some cool things that I've been working on recently. Maybe some running too.
